4thYearConnection
=================

A UVa DB project for connecting graduating 4th years

### What is it?
This site is designed to connect graduating UVa 4th years. Our hope is that new graduates could use this site to find other wahoos in their new cities and companies. Using 4thYearConnection, students can login with UVa NetBadge authentication, build post-graduate profiles, use the site to search for other grads, learn where their class is going, message students moving to their city or working for their company, and find roommates. 

### Project Intro
Alex Charters, Nick Allen and I put this project together for a databases class project. There were some parameters of the project that should be mentioned--for one, we were not allowed to use an ORM. The project had to be created on the LAMP stack, and all database interfacing had to be written by hand. In addition, a minimum of 10 tables was required (which hopefully explains the very large database layout).
